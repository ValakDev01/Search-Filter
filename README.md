# Search Filter Project ðŸ’¥

<br />

## Description ðŸ’¬

This project is a simple contact management tool built using React and React Bootstrap. It features a search functionality that allows users to filter through a list of contacts in real-time. The contact list is displayed in a table format, showing each contact's first name, last name, email, and phone number. As the user types into the search bar, the list updates dynamically to match the search query, filtering based on the first name. The layout is styled with Bootstrap components, ensuring a clean and responsive design.
